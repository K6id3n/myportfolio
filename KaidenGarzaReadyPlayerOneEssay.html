If the user is aware of the information they are giving out in the Oasis they will be left alone by most people. In the book Haliday states, &quot;I created the OASIS because I never felt at home in the real world. I didn&#39;t know how to connect with the people there. I was afraid, for all my life.&rdquo; (Cline 364), this is a testament to the fact that the Oasis gives the interaction and experience of the real world without the danger.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One positive thing about this digital world is that it is able to connect people who otherwise wouldn&#39;t be able to or even have the chance to. For example Wade and Art3mis&rsquo;s meeting is proof that the Oasis is a social tool. </span><span>&ldquo;</span><span>She made me laugh. She made me think. She changed the way I saw the world. I&#39;d never had such a powerful, immediate connection with another human being before.</span><span class="c0">&rdquo;(cline 174), this a quote showing Wade&rsquo;s feelings towards Art3mis , even though this is one sided (at this point of the book) it shows that being public on the Oasis can build relationships we never thought were possible.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One other way the Oasis is good at building relationships is that it provides a safe and open space for people of the LGBTQIA+ community. All lot of the people in this demographic experience hate at multiple times in their life, in the Oasis it is as simple as muting the other person and the problem goes away. This makes a safe space for people to build these non-traditional relationships and find who they really are. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Oasis is undoubtedly an amazing place for expression in many different forms such as music, video, art, poetry, fashion, language, and infinite amounts of possibilities for anyone to display regardless of their background. A quote from wad shows just how abstract people can be if they truly wish to be, &ldquo;</span><span class="c0">It suddenly occurred to me just how absurd this scene was: a guy wearing a suit of armor, standing next to an undead king&rdquo;, this is a example of how the Oasis is used for people to take a break from life and be who they want to be.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One way the Oasis can build character is that it can be a space to relax or for users to take their anger out on something or someone with the consent of both parties. The Oasis has many PvP arenas as stated in the book and each with different rules, parameters, and styles, so that any user looking to blow off some steam will have something or somewhere to go to do so.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Oasis also provides a healthy and consistent work environment for educators. In the Oasis schools things like physical and verbal bullying are non issues, because of the fact that it&#39;s virtual so they can not physically hurt anyone, and if they verbally abuse anyone, the victim can simply mute them and never have to deal with them again. In the Oasis schools people can do so well because it also provides a care and distraction free environment to learn. It makes it easy for people to focus because between the headset and headphones there is nothing that could get in the way of a lesson. In chapter two Wade talks about how he prefers Oasis school to normal, real life school, because of functions like this. The Oasis also makes things like free education available to all which in the long run, will do so much good for society. Many kids who end up being &ldquo;dead beats&rdquo;, or &ldquo;failures&rdquo;, just never got the chance to grow and become the person they were meant to be. A lot of the time this just means they didn&#39;t have available schooling, the Oasis is made for these people, to give them an opportunity to become the best possible version of themselves.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Oasis is also a flourishing place for the economy. It provides a whole new genre of concessions and merchandise. It provides a safe way for users to shop and an efficient way for vendors to advertise, as well as it provides a place for users to discuss and present or pitch business ideas and plans to each other.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Oasis includes a gigantic library of movies just with access to the Oasis, just like this there are many other forms of media and recreation. There are also other recreational activities like different types of games that the user could take part in. This is good because not only does it provide an outlet for the user, it provides a way for the user to bond with family, friends, or lovers.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Oasis is such a good idea because not only does it provide a world for those who are uncomfortable in the real world but it provides a world for those who are unable to take part in the real world. There are lots of people with disabilities that range from not being able to walk to being completely unable to do anything. The Oasis and digital worlds in general provide an accessible and entertaining way for people with hindered abilities to function like the average human to be themselves which is the most important thing for humans. Allowing a user to be themself no matter what is stopping them in the real world is such a valuable asset of the Oasis. These people were robbed of their lives and the Oasis gives them an opportunity to live like a normal person.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c0">With the way the Oasis works in Ready Player One, it could also promote physical health and wellbeing. Especially in a time plagued by short form media and high calorie low volume foods, it is often people forget that it is important to move. Many people tend to &ldquo;let themselves go &#39;&#39; and often gain weight, as they gain more weight their movement is reduced more and more creating a vicious cycle. The Oasis breaks that cycle. The Oasis makes you move while getting all the pluses you get from tech.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Needless to say, the Oasis will always be a safe space to do things like love, learn, create, express, and relax. It has infinite amounts of virtual possibilities, for anyone to do anything, anywhere, at any time, and anyway without the negatives of the real world. The Oasis will always be a productive, positive, and safe way to develop a person&#39;s character and social battery.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c4 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span>Ernest Cline </span><span class="c8">ready player one </span><span class="c0">2011</span></p><div><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p></div></body></html>
